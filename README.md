# Kanak - How am I doing financially?

Kanak is a personal project. It combines three things, but in a way I want it.
It is going to be a wealth manager, expense tracker, and a budgeting tool. It is
specifically designed for my personal use case. If the solution works for you please
note that it is through sheer luck. It may not work in future for you.

I loved Kubera[1], I really liked it, but it met only part of my requirement, what
I wanted was an app that combined both wealth tracking and an expense manager. While
I came across many wonderful solutions for expense tracking too and currently use
Home Budget[2] on my phone to track my expenses, but again want a single application,
that will eventually work across desktop, web and mobile.

Here are the questions I want to answer in a single application.

1. What was my income this month/year?
2. What were my expenses this month/year?
3. Are there any expenses that I should be aware of ahead?
4. How did my investments do this year?
5. What is the status of my liabilities this year?

In addition, there is a worry about the entire financial information being stored
online is a bad way, so this uses syncing between devices, with encrypted backups.

No information is stored online with the exception of the encrypted backups. However
to track the value of assets, we may use linked assets, which will have values queried,
no history of it will be kept but it will be made.
